# Rent-prices-in-the-US

The original data was obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zillow/rent-index

Zillow produces rent estimates based on proprietary statistical and machine learning models. The availability of data is
only from November 2010. Zillowâ€™s machine learning model observes rental listings and any attributes including physical
facts about a home, prior sale transactions, tax assessment information and geographic location along with an estimated
market value to estimate rental properties on all homes for rent

The dataset includes the city, population rank, the prices (in USD $) of rent per month, the dates, city, county, and state
for each property

Data Questions:
1. What are the cheapest and most expensive cities to live within the top 500 densely populated cities?
2. What cities have had the most fluctuations in rent prices over the years?
3. Are there any seasonal changes for rent that are common throughout the data?
